## NPM
Because you've installed node before you have access to NPM. With NPM you can install all the packages/dependencies for the project. These dependencies are inside the package.json file. To install these dependencies all you have to do write this line of code in your terminal:

```
npm install
```
**Make sure you write this line of code inside the root folder of your project!**

## Start server

To start the Express server, all you have to do is write this line of code in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Inside the package.json the start script is defined as nodemon start. This means dat the nodemon package serves this start script. With nodemon the changes are constantly watched and with this package you don't have to start your server over and over again because the files inside the project are constantly watched.
